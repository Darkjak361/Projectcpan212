Canada Weather App

This is a simple weather app that shows the current weather for Canadian cities. Once you log in or sign up, you can search for the weather of any city, and the app will show the current weather, including temperature, description, and icons. You can also save your favorite city as a preferred location.
Features

    View current weather for Canadian cities.
    Log in or sign up to search for weather in any city.
    Know what to wear for the weather.
    Displays hourly and weekly weather forecasts.

Installation

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/canada-weather-app.git

Navigate into the project folder:

cd canadaweather

Install the required dependencies for both frontend and backend.

For the backend (in the backend folder):

cd backend
npm install

For the frontend (in the frontend folder):

    cd frontend
    npm install

Running the App

    Start the backend server:

    Go to the backend folder and run:

npm start

This will start the backend server on http://localhost:5000.

Start the frontend server:

Go to the frontend folder and run:

    npm start

    This will start the frontend on http://localhost:3000.

    Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser, and you should be able to see the weather dashboard.

How it works

    When you first open the app, it shows the weather for several cities in Canada.
    Once you log in or sign up, you can use the search bar to search for weather in any city.
    After logging in, you can also save your preferred city for quick access later.

Things Used

    Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT for user authentication

    
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
